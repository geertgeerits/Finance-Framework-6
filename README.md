# Finance
Financial applications.

The program is partly based on Finance that I wrote in Visual Basic 5.00 (year 1992).
The supporting languages are: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
The program was tested on a Samsung Android 8 and 12 phone (link on Google Play Store below).
